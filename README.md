# Scikit optimize fork

This is a fork of the scikit-optimize project https://scikit-optimize.github.io/ but with some tiny changes made to numpy data types to make it compatible with the recent numpy versions.
For some reason scipy doesn't seem to want to install as dependency. You probably have this anyway but otherwise install separately.

## Installation
    `pip install git+https://github.com/mikesmithlabteam/skopt`
